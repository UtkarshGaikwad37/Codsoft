1) Random module: The random module in Python provides functions to generate random numbers, strings, and other random selections. We will be using the random.choice() function to randomly select characters for our password.

2) String module: The string module in Python provides a collection of constants that represent various character classes. We will be using the string.ascii_letters, string.digits, and string.punctuation constants to generate a pool of characters for our password.

3) Joining strings: The join() method in Python is used to concatenate a sequence of strings. We will be using it to join the randomly selected characters into a single password string.
