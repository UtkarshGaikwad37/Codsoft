1) Function Definitions: The first part of the code defines four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function takes two arguments (x and y) and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.

2) Main Program: The second part of the code prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired arithmetic operation. It then uses conditional statements to determine which arithmetic operation to perform and calls the corresponding function. Finally, it displays the result to the user.
